# DevDayDecember
Mini project developed during December and February Dev Days

Initally, select [y/n] to enable/disable colours. On default windows command line, colours are not supported the same, so 'n' should be selected.

When the game loads, press an arrow key to begin. Then, use the arrow keys to buffer directional inputs for the snake to travel. Multiple key presses will be remembered and played out in sequence, so do not spam.
